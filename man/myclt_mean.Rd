\usage{
myclt_mean(n, iter, a = 0, b = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations.}

\item{a}{Lower bound of the Uniform distribution.}

\item{b}{Upper bound of the Uniform distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of simulated sample means (invisible).
}
\description{
Generates sample means from a Uniform(a, b) distribution to demonstrate
the Central Limit Theorem and overlays the theoretical normal curve.
